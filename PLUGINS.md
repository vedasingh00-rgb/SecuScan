### Hashcat Output Artifacts

- Session files for resumable runs
- Potfile entries containing recovered hashes
- Recovered credential output returned by the parser

Review and remove these artifacts after authorized assessments.

### SQL Injection Plugin Guidance

- `sqli_checker` should be used to validate whether a target appears vulnerable to SQL injection and to assess feasibility before exploitation.
- `sqlmap` should be used for SQL injection testing and controlled database enumeration during assessment workflows.
- `sqli_exploiter` should be used only after a vulnerability has been confirmed and exploitation or data extraction is required.

## Plugin Input Schema with Examples

Plugins can tell us about configurable user inputs through schema fields in their
`metadata.json`.

### Supported Field Types

Example schema:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "target",
      "label": "Target URL",
      "type": "string",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "https://example.com",
      "help": "Full URL of the target including scheme.",
      "validation": {
        "validation_type": "url",
        "message": "Enter a valid URL starting with http:// or https://"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "scan_type",
      "label": "Scan Type",
      "type": "select",
      "required": true,
      "options": [
        { "value": "quick", "label": "Quick" },
        { "value": "full",  "label": "Full"  }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "checks",
      "label": "Checks",
      "type": "multiselect",
      "required": false,
      "options": [
        { "value": "headers", "label": "Headers" },
        { "value": "ssl",     "label": "SSL"     },
        { "value": "cookies", "label": "Cookies" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "recursive",
      "label": "Enable Recursive Scan",
      "type": "boolean",
      "required": false,
      "default": false
    },
    {
      "id": "timeout",
      "label": "Timeout (seconds)",
      "type": "integer",
      "required": false,
      "default": 30,
      "validation": {
        "min": 1,
        "max": 3600
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "wordlist_path",
      "label": "Wordlist Path",
      "type": "path",
      "required": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Field Types

| Type Value | Input Rendered | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `string` | Text input | Use `validation.validation_type` for URL, hostname, IP, etc. |
| `integer` | Number input | Use `validation.min` / `validation.max` for range |
| `boolean` | Toggle / checkbox | `default` should be `true` or `false` |
| `select` | Dropdown (single) | `options` must be `[{ "value": ..., "label": ... }]` |
| `multiselect` | Checkbox group | Same options shape as `select` |
| `path` | File-path text input | No validation block needed |

For the full list of named validation presets (e.g. `url`, `hostname`, `domain`, `ipv4`, `port`, `cidr`) and range rules, see [plugin-validation.md](docs/plugin-validation.md).

### Required vs Optional Fields

- `"required": true` means that the user must provide a value before running the plugin.
- `"required": false` means that the field is optional.
- Optional fields may define a `"default"` value.

### Preset Mapping

Plugin presets shall map directly to schema keys.

Example presets:

```json
{
  "presets": {
    "quick": {
      "target": "https://example.com",
      "scan_type": "quick",
      "recursive": false,
      "timeout": 30
    },
    "thorough": {
      "scan_type": "full",
      "recursive": true,
      "timeout": 300
    }
  }
}
```

Each preset key shall exactly match a corresponding field `"id"` value.

## Maintenance Notes

- If a plugin is added, renamed, or removed, update this file from the plugin metadata rather than editing counts by hand.
- Prefer keeping `id`, category, safety level, and dependency names aligned with each plugin's `metadata.json`.
## Checksum Maintenance

Plugin metadata files include integrity checksums. If you edit a plugin's
`metadata.json` or `parser.py`, you must refresh the checksum before committing
or the backend will reject the plugin during load and unrelated backend tests
will fail.

Use the helper script to refresh checksums:

```bash
# Refresh a single plugin after editing it
python scripts/refresh_plugin_checksum.py --plugin <plugin-id>

# Example
python scripts/refresh_plugin_checksum.py --plugin nmap

# Refresh all plugins at once
python scripts/refresh_plugin_checksum.py --all

# Preview what would change without writing anything
python scripts/refresh_plugin_checksum.py --all --dry-run
```

Run this script any time you:
- Edit a plugin's `metadata.json` fields
- Edit a plugin's `parser.py`
- Add a new plugin

After refreshing, run the backend tests to confirm the plugin loads correctly:

```bash
cd backend && python -m pytest
```

### Example 1 — Refresh a single plugin after editing its files

Run this after editing `plugins/nmap/metadata.json` or `plugins/nmap/parser.py`:

```bash
python scripts/refresh_plugin_checksum.py --plugin nmap
```

When the checksum is already up to date, the script reports the plugin as
`[OK]` and exits cleanly with no files modified.

When the checksum is outdated, the script prints the old and new digest values,
writes the updated checksum back into `metadata.json`, and confirms the update.

### Example 2 — Preview all plugins without writing anything (dry run)

Run this to check which plugins are out of date before committing:

```bash
python scripts/refresh_plugin_checksum.py --all --dry-run
```

In dry-run mode no files are modified. Each plugin reports either `[OK]` if
its checksum is current, or `[UPDATE]` showing what would change. A clean
state means every plugin reports `[OK]` and the final line shows zero failures.

If any `[UPDATE]` lines appear, run the same command without `--dry-run` to
apply the changes before committing.

## Plugin Validation

Validate a single plugin without loading all plugins:

```bash
# Validate by plugin id
python scripts/validate_plugin.py --plugin <plugin-id>

# Example
python scripts/validate_plugin.py --plugin nmap

# Or pass a path to the plugin directory
python scripts/validate_plugin.py --plugin plugins/nmap
```

The validation checks metadata JSON, required fields, checksums, and custom
parser imports when applicable.

### Metadata quality lint rules

Two additional lint checks help maintain high-quality plugin metadata:

1. **Missing field help text** — Each field in the `fields` array should include
   a `help` string that provides a brief user-facing description of the input.
   Fields without `help` text produce a lint **warning** (the plugin is still valid).

   ```json
   // Good — has help text
   { "id": "target", "label": "Target", "type": "text", "help": "IP address or hostname to scan" }

   // Bad — missing help text (lint warning)
   { "id": "target", "label": "Target", "type": "text" }
   ```

2. **Ambiguous category** — Each plugin's `category` must be one of the
   recognized categories: `recon`, `vulnerability`, `web`, `exploit`, `network`,
   `expert`, `code`, `forensics`, `utils`, `execution`, `security`, `robots`.
   Unknown or misspelled categories cause a validation **error** and block
   the plugin from being loaded.

   ```bash
   # Run the linter
   python scripts/validate_plugins.py
   ```

Existing plugins can be brought into compliance incrementally — the help
text check is a non-blocking warning, and unknown categories cause a
clear error message identifying the problem.

## Catalog Validation (For Contributors)

To prevent the index, categories, and metrics in this file from drifting out of sync with the live plugin directories, a validation tool is provided.

Before submitting a Pull Request that adds, removes, or modifies a plugin, ensure the catalog is synced by running:

```bash
python scripts/validate_plugins_catalog.py
